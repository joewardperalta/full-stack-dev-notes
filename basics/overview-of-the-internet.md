# Overview of the Internet

This unit introduces the basics of web development and software 
engineering, including how the internet works, what programming means, 
and the roles of front-end, back-end, and full-stack developers.


## What is a Network

A **network** is a system of **interconnected devices** that can 
communicate with each other and share resources.

### Interconnected

Devices are **linked or connected** in a way that allows 
**interaction and communication**.

### Example

- **WI-FI** is a type of network that connects multiple devices so 
they can access the internet and communicate with one another.


## The First Interconnected Network

**ARPANET**, developed in 1969 and funded by the U.S. Department of 
Defense, was the first interconnected network and a precursor to the 
internet. It was designed to connect supercomputing centers at 
government agencies and universities to share information.


## Protocols

Institutions wanted to communicate and share information, but they 
couldn’t because they used different rules and systems. This is why 
**TCP/IP** was created—to provide a standard way for networks to 
communicate. The interconnected global network of networks that is 
today known as the internet was formed.

### TCP

The **Transmission Control Protocol** ensures that data is sent and 
received correctly.

### IP

The **Internet Protocol** handles the address system so data knows 
where to go.


## Internet

The internet refers to the actual network of connected devices. 
Its primary purpose is to send messages from one computer to another. 
There is no specific built-in way for people to browse information on 
the internet, which is why the **World Wide Web** was created.


## World Wide Web

The World Wide Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee. It’s a collection 
of interlinked websites and other web resources. It’s like a library 
full of content.

In 1990, the rise of web browsers began, providing an intuitive way 
for people to browse the internet and access information on the 
World Wide Web.


## Browsers and Servers

On the internet, information is sent from one computer to another. 
This process is explained by the **client-server model**.

The **client-server model** is a system where one computer 
(the client) requests information and another computer (the server) 
provides it.
