# Introduction to HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)

## What is HTML

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the foundational language 
used to structure content on the web. It acts as the skeleton of a 
webpage, organizing elements like text, images, buttons, and videos.

## Markup Language

A way to annotate content—like labeling parts of a webpage 
(headings, paragraphs, images)—so browsers know how to display them. 
Just like a teacher marks up an essay with notes, HTML uses tags to 
structure and format content on the web.
