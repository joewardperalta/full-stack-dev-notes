# Introduction to HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)

## What is HTML

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the foundational language 
used to structure content on the web. It acts as the skeleton of a 
webpage, organizing elements like text, images, buttons, and videos.

## Markup Language

A way to annotate content—like labeling parts of a webpage 
(headings, paragraphs, images)—so browsers know how to display them. 
Just like a teacher marks up an essay with notes, HTML uses tags to 
structure and format content on the web.

## HTML Elements

**HTML tags** are the "markup" in HTML. They act like labels or 
annotations that tell the browser what type of content is inside them. 
Tags are used to **wrap content**, turning it into an **HTML Element**
. For example, a paragraph, heading, or image. The structure includes
an **opening tag**, the **content**, and a **closing tag**.

### Example

This example creates a paragraph element with the content 
"*Hello, my name is Joeward*".

```<p>Hello, my name is Joeward</p>```
