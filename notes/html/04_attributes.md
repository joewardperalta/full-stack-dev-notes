# HTML Attributes

An attribute is extra information added to an HTML tag that helps define its behavior, appearance, or functionality.

Attributes are always written in the opening tag, and they follow this pattern:

```html
<tagname attribute="value">Content</tagname>
```

## id

The `id` attribute in HTML is used to give a unique name to an element. It helps identify that one specific element on the page.

### Example

```html
<p id="intro">Welcome to my website!</p>
```

### Important Rule

Each `id` must be unique and should appear only once on a page
