## What is JavaScript

**JavaScript** is a powerful programming language used 
to make web pages **interactive** and **dynamic**. It's
one of the core technologies of the web, alongside HTML
and CSS.

While HTML structure the content and CSS styles it, JavaScript
handles user interaction within the website, dynamically update
content, and much more.

etc.
- **Dynamic Content** - updates text, images, or styles without 
reloading the page
- **Form Validation** - checks if input is correct before submitting
- **Animations** - creates smooth transition, sliders, and effects
- **APIs & Data** - fetches and displays data from servers or services
- **Games & Web App** - powers everything from simple games to full
applications like Gmail or Facebook.
